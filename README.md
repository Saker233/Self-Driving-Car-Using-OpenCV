# Self-Driving-Car-Using-OpenCV

Made a prototype RC car controlled with Raspberry Pi and a Pi Camera to detect the lane on the road and calculate its slope angle using Hough Transform, then get a steering angle to control the motors of the car with PWM
Also the camera was able to detect the road's stop signs and the traffic lights and give orders to the motors to stop for a time then continue straight
